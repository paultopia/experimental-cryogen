# An

## Experiment

### Like Woah. 

<code class="clojure">
((comp (partial apply +) (partial map (partial * 3))) [1 2 3])
</code>

Let's see what happens if I use a language that isn't supported by klipse, like haskell! 

<pre class="haskell">
sum . map (*3) $ [1, 2, 3]
</pre>

I wonder if I can use python? 

```
import foo
print "meow"

for x in y:
    print x
```

hmm, I'd need to give it another class or something here.  This might well just require writing javascript to sweep through it.  

my slack posts:

> has anyone out there figured out how to automatically klipse-ify code blocks in posts generated by cryogen?  I'm thinking that probably the easiest thing to do would be to just stick in some javascript at the end to automatically add klipse classes to all code blocks, but if there's a more straightforward way I'd love to hear it...

Let's try another python one.

<code class="python">1 + 2
